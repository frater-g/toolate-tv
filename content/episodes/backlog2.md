# Episode Content

Dr. Supreme and I were having a chat with a lawyer friend of ours when the show got crashed by Mr. Party, the representative of our new owners, the Bayadara group. He has a form of sitcom amnesia where he thinks it's 2010 all the time. It's kind of based but also makes it really hard to be in the car with him because all he does is scream SKIRLLEX over and over again

## Show Notes
